                        <p class="text">Maps are the space or arena where players confront one another. This term is used almost exclusively when describing multiplayer games. Maps in the Counter-Strike series pit Terrorists against Counter-Terrorists in real-world style locations. In some map scenarios, players are awarded money for completing the map's objectives or by eliminating players from the opposing team. Arsenal scenario maps rewards players with new weapons for completing objectives.</p>
                            
                        <h3>Custom Maps</h3>    
                        <p class="text">Custom maps are maps that were created by map developers outside of the official game development company. They are often created for custom game modes and feature mechanics that are not present in the base game. Most of the current official maps were at one time a custom map. Similar to the naming scheme used for official maps, custom maps use a prefix to identify what scenario they were created for. For example, "surf" denotes a surfing map, while "zm" is used for zombie maps. Some custom maps are exclusive to human players, while the bots cannot walk around effectively in some custom maps.   
                            
                        <br>
                        <br>
                            
                        När en karta tas bort från kartpoolen ersätter Valve den med en annan karta – det senaste tillskottet är Vertigo. Hittills har Dust2, Train, Inferno och Nuke uppdaterats, medan större ändringar gjorts av Overpass över en längre tid. Mirage har till stor del förblivit oförändrad sedan den togs med i kartpoolen den 1 juli 2014.</p>
                           
                        <h3>Active Duty Map Pool</h3>
                            
                        <p class="text">The active duty map pool consists of 7 maps, as of right now these are the current maps in the map pool.</p>

                        <h3>About Mirage</h3>
                        <p>The map is themed like a Middle Eastern town, but because of its close resemblance to Moroccan style architecture, it is likely set somewhere in Morocco.
                            
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        
                        Mirage is the Global Offensive version of the Counter-Strike community map de_cpl_strike, created by Michael "BubkeZ" Hull. Hull originally created de_cpl_strike for the Cyberathlete Professional League (CPL). Hull later created a non-CPL version of the map and named it Mirage (de_mirage). It was a popular community map in the Counter-Strike community for years, and a version of the map was even made for Counter-Strike: Source.
                            
                        <br>
                        <br>

                        After Global Offensive was released, Valve decided to remake the map and include the map as an official bomb defusal map. As with all official maps, Valve updated the visuals and tweaked the gameplay for better competitive play. For instance, the original versions of Mirage had textures similar to Italy, but was later updated to reflect a Moroccan style.</p>

                        <p>The map's setting is a canal overpass and the park built above it in Berlin, Germany. The GSG-9 must protect a stalled military shipment on a canal overpass while the Phoenix Connexion can either attack the shipment head-on or attempt to destroy the overpass itself by bombing the pillar below.

                        The Counter-Terrorists spawn in bombsite A, where the disabled cargo truck is located at. Meanwhile, the Terrorists' Spawn Zone is around the bottom of the canal.

                        Bombsite B is located below the CT Spawn Zone and can easily be accessed from a stairwell. In here, snipers can easily guard here as a sniper nest is positioned towards the entire site.

                        <p>The map is set in a small town with European architecture. In the Global Offensive version, the presence of the Separatist faction suggests that the map is definitely set in Italy, as evidenced by the signs written in Italian seen around the map. However, the separatist faction is also present in the Basque country of Spain and France, so it's plausible it could be there, too.

                        The map is loosely rectangular, with the Counter-Terrorists spawning on one corner of the map and the Terrorists on the diagonally opposite corner, and the two bombsites sitting at the other two corners.

                        <h3>About Vertigo</h3>
                        <p>Vertigo is based on a skyscraper that was under construction and centered the conflict between the Counter-Terrorist and the Terrorist teams. The main objective for the Terrorists were to bomb the building while the CTs must prevent them from achieving their goal.
                            
                        <br>
                        <br> 
                            
                        Near the Terrorist Spawn Zone, there is a ladder leading from the first playable floor to the second playable floor that appears to be inaccessible from the bottom. In Global Offensive, a teammate can boost you up by crouching below the ladder. Prior to Global Offensive, the ladder can still be accessed from the bottom without teammates by carefully jumping from nearby ladders laying on the floor.
                        
                        <br>
                        <br>
                            
                        Another (infamous) fact is a CT can jump from the top spawn zone to descend below and quickly kill Terrorists at the beginning of a round. This is often achieved with a Negev or P90.

                        <p>Dust II, also known as Dust2 (de_dust2) is a Bomb Defusal map featured in the Counter-Strike series. It is the successor to Dust.
                        One of the most popular maps in the Counter-Strike series due to its strong balance, Dust II is an iconic map for the Counter-Strike franchise. It is widely played on many servers and is a popular choice for Counter-Strike tournaments as well.    
                            
                        <br>
                        <br>
                            
                        The map appears to be set in the Middle East, similar to its predecessor Dust. An earlier version of the map lack many identifying features, with the only identifying features being what looks like sandstone textures for walls and sand for floor.    
                            
                        <br>

                        Later games added more visually identifiable features to show the map's setting. The original Global Offensive version featured Islamic architecture and presence of military and conflict activity such as Humvees and bombed walls, reflecting a contemporary view of the Middle East. In the revamped version, the map is set in Morocco, which is not in the geographic region of Middle East, but featured similar architectural styles

                        Because of its similarity to the map de_aztec and because the textures and props in the source code were named after de_aztec, it can be assumed that Ancient is a kind of unofficial remake of Aztec.

                        <p>The map takes place in a warehouse containing nuclear materials or a nuclear power plant. In Global Offensive, the original version of the map takes place a German nuclear power plant, while the revamped version takes place in an American one.

                        Unlike most Counter-Strike bomb defusal maps, the map revolves around a central structure rather than multiple lanes, with the two bombsites being overlapped on top of each other.</p>
